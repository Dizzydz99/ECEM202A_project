# Abstract

Computing the angles of tilt for a device serves various purposes in the realms of human motion tracking and virtual reality. Conventional approaches involve integrating data from accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes to fuse sensor information. Nonetheless, gyroscopes are more demanding in terms of power consumption and cost when compared to the aforementioned sensors. In this project,I employed a machine learning approach on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Rev2 to attain accurate inclination estimation, leveraging data from accelerometers, magnetometers, and a limited number of gyroscope samples. 

# 1. Introduction

This section should cover the following items:

* Motivation & Objective

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is important for various applications, particulary in the fields of robotics, virtual reality and wearable technology. IMUs play a crucial role in providing valuable information about motion sensing. However, gyroscopes are more expensive and power hungry compared to accelerometers and magnetometers. In IoT, power consumption is a critical concern and the project aims to reduce power consumption by using alternative sensors to mimic a gyro's functionality to make IoT devices more energy-efficient. Machine learning method is used for accurate inclination estimation based on accelerometers and magnetometers and limited number of gyro samples.
